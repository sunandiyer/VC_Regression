READ ME for Regression of Venture Capital Data

The Data was downloaded from Quandl and the data sets are available. The goal of this project was to be able to predict the value of the NASDAQ OMX 100 Index. The three variables used were total amount of VC money raised, average M&A Deal Size, and average IPO size. The data for the three variables was considered to be quarterly, so the date used to predict the value of the index is the end of the quarter date. 

The dataProcessing.py file contains the code the process the data. This file reads in the 3 CSV files and extracts the information I want. It makes sure that the dates match up for each variable. The 3 arrays (for the 3 variables) and an array for the index values are created. To help with the regression I also created an array of only 1's that will be the first column in the final array. I then appended all the arrays together and converted them to a data frame. I then exported this data frame as a CSV called output.csv. 

The LinRegFunc.py file contains the functions to perform linear regression. These functions are for feature normalization of the training data, gradient descent, and feature normalization of the test data. 

The main.py file is where the actual calculations occur. The output.csv file is read in and converted to an array. It is splitted into the X and y values and then split into training and testing data. The training data was normalized. My initial theta guess was just all 1s. I ran gradient descent for 250 iterations for alpha values ranging from 0.01 to 1 (incrementing by 0.01). I stored the error value for each alpha value and used the alpha which produced the least error as my final alpha value. I ran gradient descent to get the final theta. Since my training set was normalized, I had to normalize my testing set using the mu and sigma values from the training set. I then used this normalized testing array to make my predictions. I plotted how my predictions fare up against the actual values. I then used Sci-Kit Learn's inbuilt Linear Regression tool to make predictions and saw that their predictions was the exact same as mine.
